# Java GUI Chess Learner
## How it Works
Execute main.java to run the GUI, a chess board will then load with randomized pieces. You can click each piece and the squares they are able to move to will highlight red. To randomize pieces again, exit and re run the code. Click empty squares to see the rules of chess.
